# hello-world
Good idea fairy.
Im creating a space to develope the tools I will need for my experiment on signal types in all forms of strata.
The earth is a finite resource; getting off the planet is mandatory and communicating is important no matter where we are.
I plan to figure out the possabilities for us to do that.
